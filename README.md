# odin-recipes
I'm going to code a simple recipes websit, trough this exercice I will learn
the basics of HTML and CSS and the git workflow. This is my first public
repository on Github so don't expect too much from it. Also I try to write as
much as possible in english to consolidate my skills in this language and to
get used to the english keyboard which is slightly different than the French
one. 

I hope I will succeed making this website and aknoledge a lot of new skills.
